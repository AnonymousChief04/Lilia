# Lilia
 
Lilia is a roleplay gamemode framework for [Garry's Mod](https://gmod.facepunch.com/), built as a fork of [NutScript 1.2.3](https://github.com/NutScript/NutScript). Its aim is to provide a stable, feature-rich and open-source, allowing game developers to focus on creating engaging gameplay.

## Getting Started

To get started, you can visit the comprehensive guide in that we will leave at the bottom, which provides an in-depth tutorial on how to install the basics of the gamemode. However, if you are already familiar with the process, you can quickly create your own schema by forking/copying the skeleton schema available at [Skeleton Schema Repository](https://github.com/bleonheart/Lilia-Skeleton-Schema). This contains all the essential elements required for a functioning schema, allowing you to start coding immediately.

## Framework Goals & Additional Information

Lilia is a software framework that has been developed with some specific goals in mind. One of its key objectives is to ensure full compatibility with NS plugins that have a version of 1.2 or higher. This means that users who rely on NS plugins will be able to use Lilia without any issues or conflicts for the most part.

Additionally, Lilia aims to provide partial compatibility with Helix and monetary compatibility with DarkRP. This means that users who rely on either of these systems will also be able to use Lilia, although there may be some limitations or restrictions in terms of functionality.

Another important goal of Lilia is to improve both client and server performance. This means that the software should run more smoothly and efficiently, which can lead to a better user experience overall.

Lilia also includes anti-exploitation measures and several other utilities designed to enhance the security and stability of the software. This is important because it helps to prevent users from taking advantage of vulnerabilities or bugs in the software, which can cause serious problems for other users.

It's worth noting that Lilia is a work in progress framework, which means that it's still being developed and refined over time. However, its current set of goals suggests that it's designed to be a versatile and useful tool for users who rely on NS plugins, Helix, or DarkRP, as well as those who are looking to improve the performance and security of their software.

## Development

You are welcome to submit a pull request with any beneficial changes/fixes. Currently, there are no specific contributing guidelines other than ensuring that your code is consistent with the rest of the framework.
