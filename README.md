# Lilia
 
Lilia is a dynamic roleplay gamemode framework for [Garry's Mod](https://gmod.facepunch.com/), derived from [NutScript 1.2.3](https://github.com/NutScript/NutScript). It's designed to offer a stable, feature-rich, and open-source platform, enabling game developers to focus on crafting captivating gameplay.

## Getting Started

To get started, you can visit the comprehensive guide in that we will leave at the bottom, which provides an in-depth tutorial on how to install the basics of the gamemode. However, if you are already familiar with the process, you can quickly create your own schema by forking/copying the skeleton schema available at [Skeleton Schema Repository](https://github.com/bleonheart/Lilia-Skeleton-Schema). This contains all the essential elements required for a functioning schema, allowing you to start coding immediately.
